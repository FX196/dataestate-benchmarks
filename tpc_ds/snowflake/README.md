# snowflake-tpcds

The process of running the benchmark involves generating the TPC-DS CSV files and loading into Snowflake from these files.

The process of generating data is the same, and you can use the [TPC-datagen-notebook](../databricks/TPC-datagen-notebook.dbc). Please note that you can (and should) use the same generated data for testing in Databricks and Snowflake.
